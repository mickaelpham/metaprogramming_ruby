Class Definitions
=================

* The Ruby interpreter always keep a reference to the _current class_ (or
  module). All methods defined with `def` become instance methods of the current
  class.

* In a class definition, the current object `self` and the current class are the
  sameâ€”the class being defined.

* If you have a reference to the class, you can open the class with `class_eval`
  (or `module_eval`).
